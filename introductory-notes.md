# Introductory notes

- This is the first dry-run of the `Haskell at work` course. Many things are unpolished (especially the presentation). I'll need your feedback to improve the material. Please keep notes about what could be improved, on every possible aspect, and share it with me after every Chapter of the course.

- Feel free to interrupt at any moment to ask questions or add remarks on the course material.

- I might forget about breaks. Please remind me about those when you start feeling tired and loosing attention.

- The course is structured as a code-along project. Some time I'll present the code to you, some other time I'll ask you to write a bit of code first, and then we'll discuss. At this point, we don't have intermediate commits, so you need to write the code to proceed.

- This is not necessarily an introductory Haskell course. It is an intermediate one with a practical flavor. The idea is to share how using Haskell at work could be.

- I'm not a native English speaker. Please excuse any mistake and feel free to correct me.
