# haskell-training

Principles of the course:
- create a practical application which resembles what people could do at work;
- try not to over-abstract before it is needed;
- introduce concepts only when they solve an issue (see https://mkremins.github.io/blog/doors-headaches-intellectual-need/);

## Project ideas:

- workflow management
- expenses tracking
- Lego composer
- recipes
- building instructions
- chemistry reactions
